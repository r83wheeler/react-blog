A quote that has always resonated with me is this. \"When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump, otherwise you end up staying in the same place your whole life, and that I can\'t do.\" (Abel Morales) That\'s why I joined Awesome Inc\'s Web Development Bootcamp. My career as an electrician wasn\'t very fulfilling anymore and I wanted to move into a career that is both challenging and rewarding. As a marathon runner, I am no stranger to challenges, and I\'m glad I decided to go for it.'
